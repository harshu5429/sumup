üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Integration Flow:
1.	Frontend makes UPI payments through QR scanning
2.	Round-up calculation happens automatically (nearest ‚Çπ5)
3.	Backend API creates transaction and activity records
4.	Database stores all financial data permanently
5.	Real-time UI updates savings totals and activity feeds
The entire system is designed for scalability, reliability, and user engagement while maintaining the simplicity of a mobile-first banking experience.
